## Briefly about the project

We wanted to create a dictionary app which helps us to learn new English words. Originally, we made a board game which was a fancy way to improve our English skills and later we decided that we would like to develop an application to replace the board game. This app currently contains a game mode where the players can fight against each other for the trophy, and two practice modes for the words and grammaratical structures, and an admin page-like ui where the user can manage their words.
